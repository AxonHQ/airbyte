# üêô Octavia CLI

Octavia CLI is a tool to manage Airbyte configuration in YAML.
It has the following features:
* Scaffolding of a readable directory architecture that will host the YAML configs.
* Auto-generation of YAML config file that matches the resources' schemas.
* Manage Airbyte resources with YAML config files.
* Safe resources update through diff display and validation.
* Simple secret management to avoid versioning credentials.

The project is under development: readers can refer to our [tech spec deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10RjkCzBiVhCivnjSh63icYI7wG6S0N0ZIErEIsmXTqM/edit?usp=sharing) for an introduction to the tool.

# Install
We are packaging this CLI as a Docker image to avoid dependency hell, please install and run Docker if you are not. 
The project is under development: **we have not yet published any Docker image to our Docker registry.**

0. Clone the Airbyte repository if you did not already.
1. Build the project locally (from the root of the repo):
```bash
SUB_BUILD=OCTAVIA_CLI ./gradlew build # from the root directory of the repo
```

2a. **If you are using ZSH**:
```bash
./install.sh # from airbyte/octavia-cli directory
source ~/.zshrc
octavia
```

2b. If you are not using ZSH you can create an alias in your shell of the following command: 
````bash
docker run --rm -v {}:/home/octavia-project --network host -e AIRBYTE_URL="${AIRBYTE_URL}" -e AIRBYTE_WORKSPACE_ID="${AIRBYTE_WORKSPACE_ID}" airbyte/octavia-cli:dev
````

# Current development status
Octavia is currently under development. 
You can find a detailed and updated execution plan [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1weB9nf0Zx3IR_QvpkxtjBAzyfGb7B0PWpsVt6iMB5Us/edit#gid=0).
We welcome community contributions!
